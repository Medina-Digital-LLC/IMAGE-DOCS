# Styles Directory

This folder contains all SCSS (Sass) styles for the US-B2C-Prestige Shopify theme. Styles are modularized by section, component, layout, and utility for maintainability and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è SCSS Usage

- All styles are written in SCSS for variables, nesting, mixins, and modularity.
- Use partials (files starting with `_`) for reusable code and import them into main files.
- Organize styles by feature or section for clarity and reusability.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Webpack Compilation

- **Webpack** is used to compile SCSS files into CSS.
- The main entry point is `app.scss`, which imports all other partials and section files.
- Webpack is configured via `webpack.config.js` to handle SCSS compilation, autoprefixing, and output to the appropriate assets directory.
- Hot reloading is enabled in development for rapid feedback.

### Example Webpack Rule (in `webpack.config.js`):
```js
{
  test: /\.scss$/,
  use: [
    'style-loader',
    'css-loader',
    'postcss-loader',
    'sass-loader'
  ]
}
```

## üìù How to Add Styles

1. Create or update a partial in the appropriate subfolder (e.g., `sections/_homepage.scss`).
2. Import your partial into `app.scss` or the relevant entry file:
   ```scss
   @import 'sections/homepage';
   ```
3. Run the development build:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
