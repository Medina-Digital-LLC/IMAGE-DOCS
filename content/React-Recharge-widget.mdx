## 🧩 Key Components

### `buy-button.tsx`
- Renders the "Add to Cart" button.
- Handles out-of-stock state.
- Calls `addToCart` and opens the Shopify cart drawer on success.

### `quantity-selector.tsx`
- Allows users to increase, decrease, or directly input the quantity.
- Uses Zustand store for state management.

### `index.tsx`
- Main React component (`ReactRecharge`).
- Fetches product and subscription data.
- Handles plan selection (one-time vs. subscription).
- Displays subscription rewards using Splide carousel.
- Integrates with the quantity selector and buy button.

## 🛠️ Utilities

### `utils/index.ts`
- Dynamically selects the correct Recharge API token and store identifier based on the current hostname.
- Exports `initilizeRecharge` to initialize Recharge.
- Exports `addToCart` for adding items to the Shopify cart.

### `utils/store.ts`
- Zustand store for managing:
  - `quantity`
  - `productId`
  - `sellingPlanId`
  - `selectedPlanType`

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   On mount, the widget initializes Recharge and fetches product data using the Recharge Storefront Client.

2. **State Management:**  
   All widget state (quantity, plan selection, etc.) is managed via Zustand for predictable updates across components.

3. **Plan Selection:**  
   Users can toggle between one-time and subscription purchase options. Subscription plans and rewards are dynamically loaded.

4. **Cart Integration:**  
   The buy button adds the selected product/plan/quantity to the Shopify cart and triggers the cart drawer.

## 📝 Usage

- Import and mount the main component (`ReactRecharge`) where you want the widget to appear.
- Ensure the required data attributes (e.g., `data-variant`, `data-product`) are present on the container element with id `IS-Recharge`.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Extending

- Add new components to the `components/` directory.
- Extend the Zustand store in `utils/store.ts` for additional state needs.
- Update `utils/index.ts` for new API integrations or logic.
