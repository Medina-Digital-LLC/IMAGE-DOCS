# Shopify Theme Repositories – IMAGE Skincare

This documentation outlines the structure, tooling, and workflow used across our Shopify theme repositories. These themes are based on the **Prestige** theme, which was originally purchased and customized for IMAGE Skincare's D2C and B2B storefronts.

## Repositories

We maintain four separate repositories for our Shopify storefronts:

- `US-D2C-Prestige`
- `US-B2B-Prestige`
- `UK-D2C-Prestige`
- `UK-B2B-Prestige`

Each repository shares the same foundational setup and development workflow.

---

## Tech Stack Overview

- **Base Theme:** Prestige (heavily customized)
- **Build Tool:** Webpack 5
- **Runtime:** Node.js 16+ (Node 20 used at time of documentation)
- **Local Development:** Shopify CLI
- **Deployment:** DeployBot

---

## Folder Structure

Each repo follows the same basic structure:

```
/src         # Source files (JS, SCSS, Liquid snippets, etc.)
/dist        # Compiled output – structured for Shopify theme compatibility
webpack.config.js
shopify.theme.toml
package.json
```

All development work is done inside the `/src` folder. Webpack is responsible for compiling and moving the output to the `/dist` folder, which is what gets deployed to Shopify.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Dev Environment**

   In one terminal tab, start Webpack in watch mode:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

   In another terminal tab, use Shopify CLI to run your local server:

   ```bash
   shopify theme dev --path=dist
   ```

   This setup ensures all source files are compiled and mirrored to `/dist`, which Shopify CLI uses for live previewing.

---

## Deployment

Deployments are handled via **DeployBot**. Configuration for each theme’s deployment target is managed within DeployBot itself. All pushes to the appropriate branch will trigger deployment according to the rules defined there.

> **Note:** Only use the `/dist` folder contents for deployment — this ensures Shopify receives the compiled and structured theme files.

---

## Recommended Node Version

It is recommended to use **Node.js version 16 or later**. As of this documentation, **Node.js v20** was used during development and build testing.

---

## Notes

- Avoid direct edits to the `/dist` folder — always work from `/src`.
- If you run into issues with Webpack or Shopify CLI, double-check your Node version and package dependencies.
- All theme-specific or environment-specific configurations (API keys, theme IDs, etc.) are managed outside this repo via DeployBot or the Shopify CLI config.
